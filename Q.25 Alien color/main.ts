// 25. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
// variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
// a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
// fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

// creat alien color variable
let alien_color: string = "Green";
if (alien_color == "Green"){
    console.log('that the player just earned 5 points')
}

alien_color = "Red";
if(alien_color == "Green"){
    console.log("that the player just earned 5 points")
